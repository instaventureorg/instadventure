# instaventure

Do you remember the text adventure games of the early decades of computing? Do you
like tabletop roleplaying games like Dungeons and Dragons, and wish they were
easier to play online (or wish you had people to play with)?

InstAdventure may be just the solution you've been waiting for!

With InstAdventure, you can sign up as a Game Master, and run your own text-based
adventures, with strangers or with friends. Or you can sign up to join someone else's
game, working with others in the chat to cooperatively play a single player.

Are you questing to find the seven lost jewels hidden across the kingdom before
the ancient dragon awakes and devours everything? Are you forced to team up with
your crush's jerk boyfriend in order to save your high school from the supervillain
who's hijacked your prom? Are you solving the murders no one else seems to care
about, or protecting the city from its corrupt public officials? Your imagination
is the only limit!
